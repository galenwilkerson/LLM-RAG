    "## High-Level Intuition of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a **method that improves how AI models answer questions by looking up relevant information before generating a response.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retriever**: Finds relevant information from a large collection of documents based on the question asked.\n",
    "2. **Generator**: Uses both the question and the found information to create a more accurate and informative answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RAG?**\n",
    "- **Better Answers**: By checking relevant information first, the AI gives more accurate and useful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works?**\n",
    "1. **Ask a Question**: You provide a question.\n",
    "2. **Look Up Information**: The model searches for related information from a database.\n",
    "3. **Generate Answer**: The model uses the found information to generate a well-informed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, RAG combines looking up information and generating text to give better answers."

    "## Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates a simple implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using smaller pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It involves four main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install Necessary Packages\n",
    "The code begins by installing required libraries: `transformers`, `datasets`, and `sentencepiece`. These libraries provide tools for working with pre-trained language models and datasets, and `sentencepiece` is specifically used for tokenization with the T5 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Import Libraries\n",
    "Next, the code imports necessary modules from the `transformers` library, as well as standard Python libraries for numerical operations and tensor handling. The transformers library provides access to various pre-trained models and tokenizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Load Pre-trained Models and Tokenizers\n",
    "The script loads pre-trained models and tokenizers for both the retriever and the generator components:\n",
    "- **Retriever**: Utilizes `DistilBERT`, a smaller and faster variant of BERT, for retrieving relevant documents. The `DistilBertTokenizer` tokenizes input text for the `DistilBertModel`, which generates embeddings for the input text.\n",
    "- **Generator**: Uses `T5`, a model designed for text generation tasks. The `T5Tokenizer` tokenizes input text for the `T5ForConditionalGeneration` model, which generates text responses based on the input context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Create a Knowledge Base\n",
    "The script creates a simple knowledge base, which is a list of documents containing basic factual sentences. These documents are encoded using the retriever model to create embeddings that represent the content of each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Retrieve Relevant Documents\n",
    "A function `retrieve_docs` is defined to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base based on a given query. The function:\n",
    "- Encodes the query using the retriever tokenizer and model.\n",
    "- Computes the similarity between the query embeddings and the document embeddings using dot products.\n",
    "- Retrieves the top k most relevant documents based on the computed similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Generate a Response\n",
    "Another function `generate_response` is defined to generate a text response based on the retrieved documents. The function:\n",
    "- Retrieves relevant documents using the `retrieve_docs` function.\n",
    "- Concatenates the retrieved documents to form a context.\n",
    "- Tokenizes the query and context using the T5 tokenizer.\n",
    "- Generates a response using the T5 model based on the tokenized input.\n",
    "- Decodes the generated response from token IDs back to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "The script includes an example usage section where a query (\"What color is the sky?\") is processed to generate a response. The query is passed to the `generate_response` function, which retrieves relevant documents from the knowledge base and generates an informative response using the T5 model. The response is then printed out, demonstrating the RAG system in action."
